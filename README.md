# mimeopen

open a file with file mimetype

this library is used when I design a desktop applicaiton in a
company. I need to let the user choose an editor to open a file.

current the library just support windows, mac, and ubuntu(linux).

Be care that the lib just test on ubuntu linux. for other platform
not guarantee. if you meet good idea, you can tell me.

# install

you can clone this repository, and then install it from source:

``` shell

python setup.py install

```

# usage

it's very simple:

``` python

mimeopen filename

# or

from mimeopen import mimeopen

```

# implementation

## ubuntu

**1.** get the open with list from:

- **~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list**
- **/usr/share/applications/defaults.list**

**2.** you can get all apps from **/usr/share/applications**

after you find the file type associations, you can find the application
information inside the .desktop file.

## windows

on window all the program information is saved in the registry, so just check the
registry to find out the program information.

**1.** the **HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT** contains information merged from the **HKEY_CURRENT_USER**
and **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**, you can find the all the program can deal with ext.

**2.** if you want to set the default program for the current user, you can set the
program id for the UserChoice under **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\FileExts\ext\UserChoice**

**3.** if you want to open with a program id, you can just use the program id to get
the program shell command to open the program.

you may keep care that on windows there are default edit and default open program for a
file type. If you want to set the default edit program for a file type, you need
first find out the progid and then find out the program execute path, first associate
the file ext with a progid by set **HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Classes/ext** default value
to progid, after that just create **HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Classes/Progid/shell/edit/command** key and set
the program path appending %1 for it.

# mac

mac is more easy than you think, you can just query the system **/Applications** folder.
then for each application it contains a **.plist** file to record the file extention it
can deal with, so just read it.
